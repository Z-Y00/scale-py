# Ray Machine Learning

This chapter will focus on Ray machine learning, mainly introducing libraries such as Ray Train and Ray Tune. These libraries are based on Ray's distributed computing capabilities, are targeted at machine learning and deep learning applications, and deeply integrate machine learning libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers, XGBoost scikit-learn, etc.
